# Soduku

This is a soduku game I made for my final grade 12 computer science project.

I incorporated concepts involved in Object Oriented Programming, recursion, event handling and action listeners. 

It also has a recursive solution to solve any Soduku game that the user can enter themselves.

Run Main.java to run the game!
